Heart Disease Prediction ML Project ü©∫‚ù§Ô∏è 
Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction project! In this repository, I present a supervised classification model developed using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The primary objective is to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of medical attributes, contributing to early diagnosis and intervention.

Key Components:
1. Dataset
The project begins with a comprehensive dataset containing relevant medical features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. Data preprocessing techniques are applied to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for model training.

2. Data Preprocessing
Careful data preprocessing is crucial for model performance. This project includes steps like handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables to ensure the machine learning model receives quality input.

3. Machine Learning Model
The heart of the project lies in the implementation of a supervised classification model using scikit-learn. The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict the presence or absence of heart disease. Fine-tuning parameters and model evaluation contribute to achieving an accuracy ranging from 80% to 85%.

4. Visualization
Matplotlib is employed to create insightful visualizations that aid in understanding the data distribution, feature importance, and model evaluation metrics. Visual representation enhances interpretability and communication of the project's findings.
